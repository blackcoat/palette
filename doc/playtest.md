Playtest Results
================

Palette needs to be tested to ensure that it is genuinely fun and balanced.



Observations
------------
In 'first-playable' build...

* **Rooks are more powerful than Bishops**:
	- Bishops cannot realign which diagonal they use (like in chess). Consequently, 
		- Bishops will never block one another (due to starting position)
		- Bishops can only reach half of the squares on the board
	- Rooks cover far more territory. There are only 2 positions on the board from which a Bishop can traverse the board end-to-end in a single move. Rooks can do this from 32 places.
* When **walls** are in effect, the game becomes a Go-style territory-capturing game.
* **Without walls**, players use the freedom of movement to actively deny opportunities to other players.
* Players are **not thinking about color math**. Instead, they are resorting to pattern recognition (maybe this is ok??)


Ideas Under Consideration
-------------------------
* Bigger board
* Other pieces
	- King that changes nearby colors
	- Limited-range Queen
	- Knights
* Choosing from a variety of chess pieces (would lead to asymmetric play)
* The player changes color mixing modes (i.e. additive vs. subtractive) when moving over a white or black square
* "Walls" on or off ?

Rejected Ideas
--------------
* Combos for Big Plays. This makes sense in a single-player game when you want to reward a player for doing very well, but in a competitive two-player game, such awards would only magnify disparity.
