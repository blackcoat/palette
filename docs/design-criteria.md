Design Criteria
===============

Palette should be:

* Fun! (all games should be!!)
* Accessible
	- Rules are easy to understand
	- Barrier to starting a new game is minimal
* Strategic. Playing well involves thought and planning
* Layered. Players learn more about how to play the game strategically with subsequent plays.
* Deep. There is no single "optimal" strategy. 
* Casual. Easy to pick-up and put-down
* Balanced. No play has an advantage over the other player.
* Symmetric. Starting options for both players are equivalent
* Portable. Easy-to-adapt to mobile and tablet devices
* Educational. Players should learn something new (e.g. adding and subtracting colors) through playing the game
